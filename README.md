# BoxIt
Simple iOS game based on the game "Block It"

A simple game using Cocos2d and Spritebuilder. 

You must have Spritebuilder (free on Mac App Store) installed on your machine in order to edit the GUI elements. The project will compile and run without spritebuilder, but you won't be able to change colors, graphics, and other GUI elements.

With less than 300 lines of code, BoxIt reproduces the core elements of the game Block It. 

BoxIt takes advantage of the built-in Chipmunk physics engine in Coco2d to quickly create a game with a ball bouncing off the walls. This project also includes a very simple game over screen.
